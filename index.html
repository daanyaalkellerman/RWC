                <h1>Rugby Final</h1>
                <p>Rugby is not just a sport; it's a symphony of strength, teamwork, and unwavering determination. It's a game that embodies the indomitable human spirit, where players from diverse backgrounds come together to chase a common dream. With every bone-jarring tackle, every strategic pass, and every heart-pounding try, rugby teaches us that victory is earned through sweat and sacrifice. It's a testament to the power of resilience and camaraderie, where the huddle before the match and the handshake after are as important as the fierce battles on the field. Rugby exemplifies the essence of courage, as players charge into the unknown, facing adversity head-on, and emerging as warriors, united by the bond of this beautiful, brutal game. It inspires us to strive for greatness, never giving up, and always being there for our teammates, on and off the pitch. In rugby, we find not just a sport, but a source of inspiration that echoes in our lives, reminding us that with passion and teamwork, we can overcome any obstacle that stands in our way.</p>

        </h2>

                <br>
            Rugby World Cup 2023 will take place in a year when the sport celebrates 200 years since Rugby School pupil William Webb Ellis was credited with inventing the game of rugby football by showing “a fine disregard for the rules” in catching the ball and running with it in 1823.
            <br>
            The tournament will set new standards in social responsibility, inclusion and sustainability for a major rugby event, targeting four key pillars for the tournament’s legacy:
            <br>
            <li> Acting for sustainability and circular economy</li>
            <li>Supporting education and employment</li>
            <li>Respecting and protecting the environment</li>
            <li>Promoting inclusivity</li>
            <br>
            The showpiece event in men’s rugby union 15s, Rugby World Cup 2023 will feature 20 teams – 12 of which qualified directly by finishing in the top three in their pool at Japan 2019 and eight from a global qualification process. In total, 48 matches will be played across 51 days.</p>
